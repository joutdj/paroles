# The digger's song - soprano

> Premi√®re note : si

[1.] You noble diggers all stand up now, stand up now   
You noble diggers all stand up now   
The wasteland to maintain sing cavaliers by name   
Your digging does maintain and persons all*[']* defame    
Stand up now, stand up now   

[2.] Your houses they pull down, stand up now    
You noble diggers all stand up now   
Your houses they pull down to fright your men in town    
But the gentry must come down and the poor shall wear*[']* the crown   
Stand up now diggers all   

[3.] With spades and hoes and ploughs, stand up now   
You noble diggers all stand up now   
Your freedom to uphold sing cavaliers are bold   
To kill you if they could and rights from you_ to hold    
Stand up now diggers all    

[4.] The gentry are all round, stand up now    
You noble diggers all stand up now   
The gentry are all round on each side the are found    
Their wisdom so profound to cheat us of our ground    
Stand up now stand up now    

[5.] The lawyers they conjoin, stand up now    
You noble diggers all stand up now    
To rescue they advise, such fury they_ devise,    
The devil in them lies and hath blinded both their eyes     
Stand up now, stand up now
